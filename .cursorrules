# Signals App - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
Signals is a mobile-first CRM app for JLL brokers to manage company and relationship intelligence.

## Core Constraints

### 1. Alizé UI Exclusive
- Use `@jllt/alize-ui` components EXCLUSIVELY
- NO custom components without explicit user approval
- NO custom styling (inline styles, custom CSS classes) without approval
- If a component doesn't exist in Alizé, ASK before creating it

### 2. Mobile-First Development
- Design for 375px viewport first
- Use responsive Tailwind classes from Alizé (sm:, md:, lg:)
- Desktop extensions will come later - focus on mobile

### 3. Code Quality
- Production-ready code that engineers take seriously
- TypeScript strict mode
- Clean, readable code with proper naming conventions
- Components in `components/signals/` directory

### 4. Workflow Rules
- ALWAYS validate understanding before coding
- Summarize the task in simple terms and get confirmation
- NO assumptions about design decisions
- When in doubt, ASK

### 5. Documentation
- Keep `CONTEXT.md` updated with decisions
- Document any deviations or special cases
- Log design decisions with rationale

## File Structure
```
app/
  (mobile)/           # Mobile layout group
    layout.tsx        # Mobile shell with bottom nav
    page.tsx          # Home screen
    search/page.tsx   # Search screen
    company/[id]/page.tsx
    person/[id]/page.tsx
lib/
  data/mock-data.ts   # Static mock data
  types/index.ts      # TypeScript interfaces
components/
  signals/            # App-specific compositions
```

## Alizé Components Reference
Primary components to use:
- Layout: Card, Tabs, ScrollArea, Separator
- Forms: Input, Select, Label, Textarea, Button, Checkbox
- Feedback: Badge, Avatar, Dialog, Drawer, Popover

## Data Approach
- Static mock data in `lib/data/mock-data.ts`
- TypeScript interfaces in `lib/types/index.ts`
- No API calls for MVP

## Don'ts
- Don't add features not in the wireframes

- Don't create custom color variables or themes
- Don't add animations unless specified in design
